### Hi, I'm Dasha ðŸ‘‹

My name is Daria, but you can call me Dasha. I grew up in Siberia and Moscow, got a bit cold and ended up in Thailand. I am about to enrol in a Masters in Computer Science, so this is what I've done so far.

- :telescope: Iâ€™m working as a Data Scientist and keen on NLP.

- :seedling: Exploring some math and statistics to be better.

- :zap: In my free time, I am crocheting, learning more about the world's history, learning Spanish, and participating in Kaggle competition.

- :mailbox:How to reach me: [![Linkedin Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-xufana-blue?style=flat&logo=Linkedin&logoColor=white)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daria-andreeva-ba5a1a1a5/)

- âš¡ Fun fact: I went to Thailand for a month and spent there a whole year.

I'm best reached via email: <xufana@icloud.com> or [telegram](t.me/xufana)
